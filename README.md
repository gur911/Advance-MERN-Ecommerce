When a user first visits my <b>MERN E-Commerce site</b>, they will need to <b>register</b> to create an account. After registration, they can <b>sign</b> in to access the full features of the platform.

When you first sign in to my app, you will see the home screen. On this screen, there are four main components: a left sidebar displaying products, a dynamic sliding feature on the right showcasing changing products, a section for special products in the center, and a navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the app.
