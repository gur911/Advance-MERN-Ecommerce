When you first sign in to my app, you will see the home screen. On this screen, there are four main components: a left sidebar displaying products, a dynamic sliding feature on the right showcasing changing products, a section for special products in the center, and a navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the app.

To start shopping, navigate to the shopping section where you can browse products by category. To save time and find exactly what you need, use the filter options to narrow down choices by brand, price, and other features.
